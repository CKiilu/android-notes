###VIDEO 15: USING METHODS WITH PARAMETERS

Create a method containing the parameter, for example String name, in the other class.
In the main class import the scanner utility so that the user can define the value of 'name'.
 Afterwards, to use the method call it in the main class.
 
 To input Strings use input.nextLine();. For example: String put = input.nextLine();
 
###VIDEO 16: MANY METHODS AND INSTANCES
 
 Private variables are only used within a class. Public variables are able to be used from other classes.
 
 Return types are used to determine what a method returns. If a method returns nothing use void.
 
 Comment print function: system.out.printf(format, args): Format is replaced by a string with %s between the quotation marks.
 %s refers to the string variable being referred to in args.
 
 Instance variable: A variable that's outside a method but inside a class
